##THE WURLITZER
you can see the current state of the project here: www.dsteinel.com/Wurlitzer.php

**The Wurlitzer** is a sound Controller jukebox. It plays a frequency which the user has to repeat. If he can manage it to sing the frequency, so he will be rewarded with a LED animation and a melody and he gains one level higher. There are 4 levels where the user can see if he singe too high or too low by looking at the LED’s. If the upper row flashes up then the user knows that he singe way to high. The nearer the Flushing rows get to the middle line, the nearer the singing frequency is (the same vice verca with the lower rows). There are also 4 special levels, where the user can only see if he is in the range of the frequency he dös not know if he is too high or too low.

The Wurlitzer is complety build by me. It is programmed with Arduino and it runs on a Arduino mega. You can take a look at my git-repro here: LINK. 
The Wurlitzer does not need any PC, it runs only with a power connector.
